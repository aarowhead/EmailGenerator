Bishop {Bishops Name},

{Husband First name} and {Wife first name} {Last name} have recently moved into our ward in Provo, Utah, and Bishop Chase would like to know whether there are any concerns with this family and their status in holding callings. He is CC'd on this email - if there are any concerns, we prefer you contact him directly. If there are no concerns, you can simply reply to me.

Thank you!
